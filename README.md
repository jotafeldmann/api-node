# API NODE

## Purpose

1. Setup OAuth endpoints that will handle the Google OAuth flow and create a JWT for your application and further authentication on your REST endpoints.
2. Create an REST endpoint to add an album to a list stored in a persistent storage of your choice.
3. Create an REST endpoint that returns the list of your albums.
4. Protect the endpoints with an auth middleware which uses the JWT for authentication.
